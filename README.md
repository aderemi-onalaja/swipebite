🧠 Emoji Engine (High Level)

SwipeBite uses a **custom emoji generation system** rather than relying on standard Unicode emojis.

- Emojis are AI-generated on demand
- Visual constraints enforce:
  - Rounded shapes
  - Soft gradients
  - Subtle depth
  - High clarity at small sizes
- Assets are reviewed and regenerated until they meet quality standards

See `/docs/emoji-engine.md` for full details.
